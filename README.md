# Apartment costs regression model

This model considers several variables such as size and location to assess the expense of a specific living unit. For learning purposes, I did not use Scikit-learn or any other library initially. Once my model was ready, I recreated it using Scikit-learn and then validated both versions using the RMSE metric.

Data source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krzysztofjamroz/apartment-prices-in-poland-2023q3).The data has been collected in 3rd quarter of 2023 and represents polish real estate market.
